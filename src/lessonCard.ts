/**
 * Writes one tailored review card from a corrected mistake. The live grading loop
 * hands back a one-line nudge meant for self-correction mid-solve; that makes a poor
 * flashcard, because the cue ("recall the mistake you fixed") names nothing specific.
 * So once a problem is solved we spend one explicit, cheap Sonnet call to turn the
 * mistake into a real card: a specific recall question on the front, the answer on
 * the back, with the math in LaTeX. Used both when a lesson is first captured and to
 * rebuild older cards that predate this.
 *
 * Fixed to Sonnet on purpose: it is capable and cheap, and unlike Haiku it does not
 * hang on structured output (a known web_pen / Haiku gotcha in this app).

Return JSON {front, back}:
- "front": a SPECIFIC, self-contained question that tests the precise point the learner got wrong, phrased so they have to recall the answer themselves. Name the concrete case: the exact sub-part, expression, identity, rule, or step. Never a vague "what was your mistake" and never the bare problem statement. Do NOT reveal the answer on the front.
- "back": the correct answer, with a one-line reason, and you may name what they had wrong.
Write ALL mathematics in LaTeX between single $ delimiters (for example $a\\cdot\\bar a = 0$ or $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$). Keep each side to one or two short lines.`;
