/**
 * The single door to OpenAI. Every request in the app goes through createCompletion(),
 * which joins a global queue with exactly one request in flight at a time: the next
 * starts only after the previous one settles. The scan loop was already serialized in
 * MainView, but the fire-and-forget lesson card and an on-demand drill could still
 * overlap a scan; owning the client here (no module holds its own) makes overlap
 * structurally impossible rather than per-caller discipline.
 *
 * The waiting line has two lanes. Scan-lane work (solve/verify/confirm, and a drill
 * the learner tapped and is waiting on) always runs before background work (the
 * lesson card): pen-lift-to-verdict silence is the loop's tightest currency, and a
 * lesson card for problem N must never sit ahead of problem N+1's first solve. One
 * client, one in-flight request, unchanged; only the waiting order is new. Each
 * request stays bounded by the client timeout per attempt (the client retries once,
 * so a stalled call delays the queue by at most ~2x the timeout).
