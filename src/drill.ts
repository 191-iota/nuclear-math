/**
 * Generates ONE practice problem targeted at a weak skill, on demand. This closes the
 * progression loop: the estimator knows the weakest skill and the ideal difficulty
 * (about 4-in-5 success, hard enough to stretch, not to stall — the deliberate-practice
 * band), but until now it could only NAME the skill; the learner still had to go find a
 * matching problem. One cheap text-only gpt-5.4-mini call turns the recommendation into an
 * actual problem to copy onto paper, where the normal grading loop takes over.

const SYSTEM = `You write ONE practice problem for a Swiss mathematics learner on the BM → Passerelle → university track, targeting one named skill at a stated mastery level. Difficulty language: level 1-2 skills are Sek/early-BM routine, level 3 is the BM/FH core, level 4 is Passerelle entrance, level 5 is university first-year stretch.

Return JSON {task, problem}:
- "task": the instruction verb line, in German (Swiss Hochdeutsch, "ss" not "ß"), e.g. "Vereinfache:", "Löse nach x auf:", "Bestimme die Lösungsmenge:".
- "problem": the bare mathematical statement to work on, ALL math in LaTeX between single $ delimiters.

Difficulty: aim for a problem the learner solves correctly about 4 times in 5 — one notch above comfortable. Below 40% mastery, write a clean single-concept problem of the skill; 40-70%, a routine problem with one twist (a sign, a fraction, a parameter); above 70%, combine the skill with one natural neighbour skill or add a step. Numbers must work out cleanly by hand (no calculator artifacts), the problem must be self-contained, and it must genuinely exercise the named skill — not merely mention it. Never include the solution, hints, or an answer blank.`;
