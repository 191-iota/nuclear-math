/**
 * Append-only observation ledger. The other stores keep only CURRENT state (theta and
 * RD, box and due date); the history that produced it is discarded, which makes the
 * rating unfalsifiable and mortal: one cache clear or origin change deletes the whole
 * record, and it has already happened once (the port migration). This ledger is the
 * durable record: one compact event per applied skill packet, per lesson review, and
 * per lesson capture, each stamped with the rater that produced it (prompt version +
 * model names), because a rating graded under one prompt version and a rating graded
 * under another are different scales and the drift is only diagnosable from raw events.
 *
 * It renders nothing and gates nothing. Consumption is offline: __nlObslog() for a
 * peek, __nlExport() to download every nl.* store as one JSON file (backup + the raw
 * material any future scheduler fit needs; no scheduler is fittable without a review
 * log). "Durable" honestly means exportable and replayable: the ledger lives in the
 * same localStorage as the state it protects, so export is the actual backup.
