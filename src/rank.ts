/**
 * Rank system, chess-style: you solve problems, the problems' difficulty is the
 * opponent's strength, and the resulting RATING is the one number that says where you
 * stand. A rank is nothing but the label on a rating band — like 2500 reading
 * "grandmaster" — so it arrives after a handful of problems, climbs (and falls) with
 * the curve, and never asks you to grind out coverage.
 *
 * The scale is anchored to the Swiss school ladder through the problem difficulties
 * the assessor already rates (1-2 Sek, 3 BM/FH median, 4 Passerelle, 5 uni stretch,
 * 6 proof-based degree core, 7 graduate-entry maturity): 400 rating points per level,
 * 1600 = solid at the BM median, 3200 = the cap at a level-7 frontier. Climbing past
 * a band therefore requires beating problems of the next band — grinding easy material
 * cannot farm the rating (confirmation cap in the estimator).
 *
 * The per-skill map (secured skills, decay, domain mastery) stays as the DIAGNOSTIC
 * layer that steers what to drill; it no longer gates the rank.

// Rank = the student identity whose IN-PROGRAM math level you perform at (not merely
// whose admission you'd clear — that keeps the ordering strict where routes overlap).
// The placements are source-grounded, not vibes:
// - HF sits BELOW BM: HF admission runs on an EFZ + work experience with no BM (only
//   ~10% of HF entrants hold one, BFS 2020), the math is applied and per-school, and
//   the FHNW's own Vorkurs page judges completed-HF math "oft deutlich unter dem
//   Niveau der technischen Berufsmatur".
// - BM math (RLP 2025) is functions, equations, vector geometry, stochastics — no
//   calculus; first real Analysis is FH year 1, and FH ENTRY is BM level by design.
// - Strong FH ≈ Passerelle-pass-capable ≈ federal-poly-entry-equivalent (~2000): the
//   poly prices a top FH bachelor at 40-60 ECTS of catch-up. Poly Student means
//   surviving the math-weighted Basisjahr, which 35-50% of admitted students fail —
//   so entry and survival are distinct rungs. ("Poly" is the historic nickname every
//   Swiss reads correctly; the institution stays out of user-facing strings by name.)
// - Above Transcendent the school ladder ends and the degree ladder begins: Poly
//   Bachelor (2800) = performing at the proof-based degree core (rigorous Analysis,
//   algebra, probability, difficulty 6), Poly Master (3200) = graduate-entry maturity
//   (qualifying-style proofs, difficulty 7) — a master's admission with nothing left
//   to prove mathematically.
// The first rank starts at the rating floor (ratings clamp at 400), so the progress
// bar through the band starts empty.
